# Telemetry

OpenTelemetry in all three apps from day 0 (ADR 013). Export is OTLP; the backend (Grafana Cloud in the MVP) is
configured only in `apps/api/src/main/` and the apps' bootstrap via env.

- **Traces**: one trace from the site click → API → Postgres → outbox → SSE event; the agent's spans link via
  `traceparent` on heartbeat/observation requests. Span names: `<context>.<use-case>` (e.g. `lobby.record-observation`).
- **Metrics**: queue wait by difficulty, ready-check acceptance, rooms reaching `active`, agent read rate,
  SSE connections, **egress bytes per player-hour**, Neon CU usage, outbox lag.
- **Logs**: structured JSON with trace id; never tokens, cookies, raw images or full chat lines.
- Attributes: bounded cardinality (difficulty, mode, region, stage). No account ids on metrics.
